== PlayYour.Work

To-do list application I made for my diploma work (really interesting idea for diploma, isnt it? =\ ).
Ruby on Rails serves backend part and Angular.js does the interface work.

=== Requirements

* Ruby ~2.2.0
* Ruby On Rails ~4.2.0

=== Installation

After dealing with requirements clone this project and install dependencies with following command:

    bundle install

Run migrations to prepare DB:

    rake db:migrate

And serve the project by running:

    rails server
